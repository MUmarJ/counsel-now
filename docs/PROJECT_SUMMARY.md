## 💡 Key Innovation: Content Inheritance

### The Problem We Solved
Traditional approach: Content scattered across multiple React components
- Hard for non-technical users to update
- Risk of breaking code when editing text
- Must search multiple files to change phone number
- Inconsistent formatting

### Our Solution: Centralized Content Config
**All content lives in ONE file:** `content.config.ts`

```typescript
// content.config.ts
export const siteConfig = {
  metadata: {
    phone: "(555) 123-4567",
    email: "contact@example.com"
  },
  hero: {
    headline: "Find Peace Through",
    headlineHighlight: "Faith & Wisdom"
  },
  services: {
    items: [/* Array of services */]
  }
}
```

### Components Inherit Content
```typescript
// app/components/Hero.tsx
import { siteConfig } from '@/content.config';

export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <h1>{siteConfig.hero.headline}</h1>
    // NO hardcoded text in component!
  );
}
```

### Benefits
✅ **For Non-Technical Users:**
- Edit ONE file to update entire site
- No React/JSX knowledge needed
- Can't break component structure
- TypeScript autocomplete helps prevent errors

✅ **For Developers:**
- Clean, maintainable components
- Content separate from logic
- Easy to internationalize (duplicate config)
- Version control for content changes

2. **Ease:** Simple booking flow (3 clicks to appointment)
3. **Clarity:** No confusion about services or pricing
4. **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliant
5. **Performance:** < 3 second load time

### Technical Excellence
